Rodinia Benchmark Suite 1.0
===========================

I. Overview

The University of Virginia Rodinia Benchmark Suite is a collection of parallel programs which targets 
heterogeneous computing platforms with both multicore CPUs and various accelerators included.

The Rodinia suite currently consists of five applications and seven kernels. They have been parallelized with 
OpenMP for multicore CPUs and with the NVIDIA CUDA API for GPUs. The suite is structured to span a range of 
parallelism and data-sharing characteristics.


II. Usage

1. Pakage Structure

rodinia_1.0/bin		: binary executables
rodinia_1.0/common	: common configuration file
rodinia_1.0/cuda	: source code for the CUDA implementations
rodinia_1.0/data	: input files (run ./get_data.sh to get these files)
rodinia_1.0/openmp	: source code for the OpenMP implementations

2. Build Rodinia

Install the NVIDIA CUDA driver, SDK and toolkit on your machine. The programs have been tested under CUDA 2.2 and GCC 4.2.4  

Modify the rodinia_1.0/common/make.config file to change the settings of rodinia home directory, CUDA toolkit path and CUDA SDK path.

To compile all the programs of the Rodinia benchmark suite, simply use the universal make file to compile all the programs, or go to each 
benchmark directory and make individual programs. Some programs also include a makefile for users who prefer to the NVIDIA style 
make file to compile GPU programs.

3. Run Rodinia

There is a 'run' file specifying the sample command to run each program.

IV. Change Log

Mar 01, 2010: Rodinia 1.0 is released
