Rodinia Benchmark Suite 2.0
===========================

I. Overview

The University of Virginia Rodinia Benchmark Suite is a collection of parallel programs which targets 
heterogeneous computing platforms with both multicore CPUs and GPUs.

II. Usage

1. Pakage Structure

rodinia_2.0/bin		: binary executables
rodinia_2.0/common	: common configuration file
rodinia_2.0/cuda	: source code for the CUDA implementations
rodinia_2.0/data	: input files (run ./get_data.sh to get these files)
rodinia_2.0/openmp	: source code for the OpenMP implementations
rodinia_2.0/opencl	: source code for the OpenCL implementations

2. Build Rodinia

Install the CUDA/OCL drivers, SDK and toolkit on your machine. 

Modify the rodinia_2.0/common/make.config file to change the settings of rodinia home directory and CUDA/OCL library paths.

To compile all the programs of the Rodinia benchmark suite, simply use the universal make file to compile all the programs, or go to each 
benchmark directory and make individual programs. 

3. Run Rodinia

There is a 'run' file specifying the sample command to run each program.

IV. Change Log

Nov 23, 2011: Rodinia 2.0.1 is released
	- Include a CUDA version of NN comparable to the OCL version.
	- Use a new version of clutils that is BSD, not GPL.
Nov 11, 2011: Rodinia 2.0 is released
	- Include several applications into the main suite:
	  lavaMD, Gaussian Elimination, Pathfinder, k-Nearest Neighbor and Particle Filter. 
	  Detailed application information can also be found at http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/wiki/rodinia
	- Merge new OpenCL implementations into the main tarball.
Mar 01, 2010: Rodinia 1.0 is released
